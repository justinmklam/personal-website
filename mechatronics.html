        <h4>Over-engineering the perfect soft-boiled egg.</h4>
        <p>Gone are the days of blindly timing and boiling eggs, being left with nothing but a solid, chalky yolk. As part of our final year mechatronics engineering project, we developed a non-invasive device to measure the oscillation of an egg suspended on a spring, By analyzing the response of the egg, we were able to determine the yolk consistency.</p>
