                    I grew up watching Star Wars, and like any other eight-year old boy, I wanted to become a Jedi Knight. Maneuvering starfighters through the Hoth asteroid field whilst in aerial combat, jousting battle droids wielding nothing but a lightsaber, and having my hand sliced off to make space for my own mechno-arm were the epitomes of my childhood fantasy.

                    Reality came quite bluntly, yet these dreams continued to flourish. These days, they follow more along the lines of developing a steering system for a model hovercraft providing optimized maneuverability, attacking design challenges with a pen and paper, and studying the possibilities of bionic technology.My passion is taking part in the vanguard of mechanical and electrical design. As a young engineer, I am constantly looking for opportunities to expand and develop my skill set.
