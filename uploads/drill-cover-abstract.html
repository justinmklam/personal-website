<h1>Abstract</h1>

<h2><em>1. Purpose</em></h2>
<p>Due to limited access to surgical power drills, orthopaedic surgeons in low-resource settings commonly use manual drills or non-sterile hardware drills.  We propose the use of a “drill cover” solution, a sterilizable fabric bag plus sealed surgical chuck adapter, to permit the safe use of hardware drills for orthopaedic surgery.  The purpose of this user study was to compare the drilling performance of covered hardware drills with manual drills and standard surgical power drills.</p>

<h2><em>2. Methods</em></h2>
<p>Orthopaedic surgeons (n=20) and lay-people (n=6) each drilled 21 holes in a cylindrical bone model (acetal), randomly alternating between hardware (DeWalt DCF610S2, maximum 1000 RPM), surgical (ConMed PRO6202M, maximum 1250 RPM), and manual drills. A custom drill cover with sealed chuck interface enveloped the hardware drill. We measured plunge depth using a sliding caliper platform, and time per hole.</p>

<h2><em>3. Results</em></h2>
<p>Differences in plunge depth between the hardware (6.73±3.24 mm; mean±SD) and surgical drill (5.68±2.44 mm) were not significant (p&gt;0.05; linear mixed models plus Sidak correction), but plunge depth was significantly larger in the manual drill (11.83±8.37 mm) compared to both powered drills (p&lt;0.001).  Differences in time per hole between the hardware (4.8±2.6 sec) and surgical (4.6±2.41 sec) were not significant (p&gt;0.05), but time was significantly greater in the manual drill (15.7±6.2 sec) compared to the powered drills (p&lt;0.001).</p>

<h2><em>4. Conclusions</em></h2>
<p>Modern surgical drilling systems are cost-prohibitive for use in low-resource settings. This study demonstrated no difference in time or plunge between the hardware and surgical power drills.  A drill cover system presents a viable, low-cost alternative to surgical drills.</p>
