      <title>From Prototype to Cloud: A Python Recipe Converter</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</link>

      <description>In case the title wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear, this blog post is about developing a web application using the Python programming language using Jupyter Lab, Flask, and the Heroku platform. If you were looking for an article on python recipes, you can start off with this one on making a poached Burmese python curry.
The Backstory The problem with online baking recipes is that the majority of them use volumetric units. As any civilized baker would know, Patricia&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour may very well be different than Patrick&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour.</description>

      <title>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Ping Sweep in C# Windows Form</title>

      <description>As a mechatronics engineer (in training), sometimes I like to pretend that I also know how to program.
In my most recent adventures to software land at MistyWest, I needed to write an application in C# that involved doing a ping sweep to find devices that were physically connected through ethernet. Since Google and Stack Overflow are my two best friends, I was able to find (what seemed to be) an off-the-net solution quite quickly.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Light therapy is one method of easing seasonal affective disorder (SAD); some people swear by it whereas others remain unaffected. This blog post does not intend to refute the effectiveness of light therapy, but rather to dig deeper into the technology behind these light therapy lamps to better educate fellow consumers.
Ah, the winter blues of Vancouver, BC. While some days bring bluebird skies and fresh pow for skiing, other days are downright gloomy.</description>

      <description>Visual Studio Code&amp;rsquo;s combination of functionality, customizability, and aesthetics makes it one of my favourite code editors. As such, I was set on making it work with embedded development since I was getting started with the STM32 line of microcontrollers. I was following the steps outlined in Mastering STM32 by Carmine Noviello (which is an excellent resource) until it said to use Eclipse, because life&amp;rsquo;s too short to use software with unnecessary bloat.</description>

      <description>Featured on Hackaday and Fictiv Blog! Yep, you heard it right. With all the craze surrounding cooking sous vide these days, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to venture using it outside of the culinary world. Turns out that someone also had a 3D printer, and you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!
Click-bait headlines aside, this post is quite lengthy and not everyone may have the patience to get through it all.</description>

      <title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the 3D printing bug.
Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called The PerfEGGct. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process.</description>

      <title>Tired of Cables in VR? We Are Too.</title>

      <description>Originally posted on Medium under MistyWest.
Virtual reality pushes the envelope of bleeding edge technology, allowing us to explore and experience worlds beyond our mortal imaginations. It gives us immersion in another dimension, providing an unprecedented medium for communication and story telling. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then virtual reality must be worth millions. Except there’s one thing keeping it grounded to reality: cables.
Since the first virtual reality headset that was hacked together in 2011, immersive head-mounted displays have progressed far and quickly.</description>

      <title>Wooden Phone Stand</title>

      <description>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.
I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs.</description>

      <title>Making Do With a Bargain Bin Bandsaw</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/bandsaw/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted a bandsaw. Being able to cut wood, plastics, etc. quickly and with flexibility has been a dream in my home shop. When I found an ad on Craigslist for a portable bandsaw for $50, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. The main caveat was that it was missing a table, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big enough issue to turn me away from this killer deal.
Fresh off Craigslist in its table-naked glory.</description>

      <description>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rdquo; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below.</description>

      <description>As you probably already know, I made a bamboo bike which I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. However, what you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.
I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo.</description>

      <title>The Making of Project Haikuza: Part 2</title>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Poetry is hard To write when algorithms Are extremely dumb.  I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description>

Haikus are simple Even children can write them maybe programs too?  Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description>

Oh boy, some beginner trip this turned out to be.
As a new member of the VOC, it quickly became apparent to me how &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; can take on drastically different meanings. In retrospect, I should have read the wiki page on &amp;ldquo;The 5 Definitions of Beginner Friendly&amp;rdquo; before agreeing to this little excursion, but a bit of Type II fun (not fun during, but makes for a great story later) never killed anyone, right?</description>

      <description>Background: Drill availability is a major limitation in developing countries, where surgeons turn to using manual hand-crank drills to perform surgeries. A common hardware drill equipped with a waterproof, sterilizable fabric cover provides a cost-effective solution in the operating room.
Objective: Develop, conduct, and analyze a study to quantify the drilling performance of the drill cover solution and compare it against a commercial surgical drill and a manual hand-crank drill.</description>

      <description>For our final MECH2 design project at UBC, we were given three weeks to research, conceptualize, test, and build a functional hovercraft. The end goal was a class-wide competition of speed, cargo capacity, maneuverability, and driving skill. Budget was limited since costs came out of our own pockets, so we set out to build an inexpensive hovercraft using parts from the hardware and dollar store.
Our result: 5th place out of 30 teams.</description>

      <description>Before the ubiquity of powerbanks, there was nothing on the market to provide longer battery life for portable electronics. Connecting a female USB connector to four rechargable AA batteries opened up a new world of extended iPod playback. I built a simple, rechargable battery pack to keep the tunes playing on long road trips.
The iPod is alive!
 President&amp;#39;s Choice rechargable batteries and some janky wiring is all it took.</description>
