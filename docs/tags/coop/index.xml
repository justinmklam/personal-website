      <title>Co-op: Drill Cover User Study</title>

      <description>Background: Drill availability is a major limitation in developing countries, where surgeons turn to using manual hand-crank drills to perform surgeries. A common hardware drill equipped with a waterproof, sterilizable fabric cover provides a cost-effective solution in the operating room.
Objective: Develop, conduct, and analyze a study to quantify the drilling performance of the drill cover solution and compare it against a commercial surgical drill and a manual hand-crank drill.</description>

      <description>Objective: Determine if age has an effect on the mechanical properties of bicycle helmets.
Tasks:
 Conducted 1630 helmet impact attenuation tests to measure the effect of age and use on bicycle helmet foam Developed scripts in MATLAB to autonomously post-process the impact data and organize information according to existing helmet databases Wrote the Methods section of the research report to be submitted to the Accident Prevention &amp;amp; Analysis Journal Assisted in protocol development of the helmet and foam core impact attenuation tests  Company: MEA Forensic Engineers &amp;amp; Scientists</description>
