      <title>Precision Sourdough: A Smart Lid for Your Starter</title>

      <description>The Backstory A few years ago, I had the idea to track my sourdough starter using computer vision. It was neat to monitor it this way, but it was fairly impractical to do for each feeding since it required setting up a camera, downloading the images, and doing some manual image cropping before running it through my analysis script. The analysis was also only done after the fact, and what I really wanted was something that could tell me when the starter was ready to be used (or fed), or, if I missed the window of opportunity, how long ago it peaked.</description>

      <description>Professional photos from Justine Russo Photography. For readers of my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring.
With this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing the ring, along with some *minor* mistakes I made.</description>

      <title>Annealing 3D Printed Plastics: Sous Vide Style</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/06/sous-vide-pla/</link>

      <description>Featured on Hackaday and Fictiv Blog! Yep, you heard it right. With all the craze surrounding cooking sous vide these days, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to venture using it outside of the culinary world. Turns out that someone also had a 3D printer, and you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!
Click-bait headlines aside, this post is quite lengthy and not everyone may have the patience to get through it all.</description>

      <title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/solder-fume-extractor/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <title>New Toy Tuesday: Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the 3D printing bug.
Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called The PerfEGGct. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process.</description>
