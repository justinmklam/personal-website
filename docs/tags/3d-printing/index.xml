      <description>&amp;ldquo;Oh so you have a 3D printer? I read on the internet that you can make a gun with it.&amp;rdquo;
 No. Just no. Sure you can model it in your favourite CAD software and print one out, but at the end of the day it&amp;rsquo;s still a goddamn plastic gun.
Rant aside, let&amp;rsquo;s say we actually wanted to make a highly functional part (aside from a weapon) using a 3D printer.</description>

      <title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <title>New Toy Tuesday: Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the 3D printing bug.
Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called The PerfEGGct. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process.</description>
