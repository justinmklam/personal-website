      <description>Professional photos from Justine Russo Photography. For readers of my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring.
With this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing the ring, along with some *minor* mistakes I made.</description>

      <description>Introduction Objective: Develop an optical scanning system to be used for generating 3D models of well liners and casings with sub-millimeter accuracy.
How: As a team of five mechatronic and mechanical engineering students, we designed and constructed an alpha prototype of the optical 3D well imager.
Project Details Requirements and Specifications Optical  Device must have a tolerance on distance measurement of 1 mm Device must have a camera circumferential resolution of 1.</description>

      <description>Background: When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.
 &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth overdoing.&amp;rdquo; - Jaime Hyneman
 Objective: Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.</description>

      <description>Background: The TrailRider™ is a specialized device to provide accessibility to the wilderness for those with limited mobility. It is intended for a seated rider propelled and balanced by assistants.
Objective: Expand the range of both riders and assistants who can ride safely use the Black Diamond TrailRider™.
How: As a team of seven mechanical engineering undergrads, we explored a range of areas for improvement and developed a new design to incorporate these features.</description>

      <title>LEGO Headphones</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2010/07/lego-headphones/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2010/07/lego-headphones/</guid>
      <description>Background: I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go.</description>
