      <description>For readers of my blog, you&#39;ll notice that I haven&#39;t had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife&#39;s engagement ring.
With this post, I&#39;d like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing the ring, along with some *minor* mistakes I made.</description>

      <title>MECH 423: Mechatronics Product Design</title>

      <description>Background: When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.
 &amp;ldquo;If it&#39;s worth doing, it&#39;s worth overdoing.&amp;rdquo; - Jaime Hyneman
 Objective: Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.</description>

      <description>Background: The TrailRider™ is a specialized device to provide accessibility to the wilderness for those with limited mobility. It is intended for a seated rider propelled and balanced by assistants.
Objective: Expand the range of both riders and assistants who can ride safely use the Black Diamond TrailRider™.
How: As a team of seven mechanical engineering undergrads, we explored a range of areas for improvement and developed a new design to incorporate these features.</description>

      <title>LEGO Headphones</title>

      <description>Background: I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&#39;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go.</description>
