      <title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <title>Wooden Phone Stand</title>

      <description>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.
I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs.</description>

      <title>New Workshop &#43; Plywood Bench Stool</title>

      <description>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rdquo; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below.</description>

      <title>Co-op: Air Quality Calibration Chamber</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/mistywest-coop/</link>

      <description>Background: Welcome to TZOA (pronounced &amp;lsquo;zoa&amp;rsquo;) - the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced environment tracker. TZOA uses internal sensors to measure your air quality, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, ambient light, and UV (sun) exposure, all in one wearable device.
Objective: Design and build a purified test chamber with zero air particulate to calibrate the TZOA devices against the DusTrak DRX 8533. An aerosolized cloud of ultrafine (0.3 - 20 μm) test dust was used to create the particle events.</description>

      <title>Co-op: Drill Cover User Study</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/coop-drill-cover/</link>

      <description>Background: Drill availability is a major limitation in developing countries, where surgeons turn to using manual hand-crank drills to perform surgeries. A common hardware drill equipped with a waterproof, sterilizable fabric cover provides a cost-effective solution in the operating room.
Objective: Develop, conduct, and analyze a study to quantify the drilling performance of the drill cover solution and compare it against a commercial surgical drill and a manual hand-crank drill.</description>
