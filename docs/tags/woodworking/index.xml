      <description>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.
I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs.</description>

      <title>Making Do With a Bargain Bin Bandsaw</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s generally known that cheap tools are usually not worth the trouble, but the deal on this bandsaw was simply too hard to pass up. With only a missing table, it was merely a quick woodworking project away from restoring its full functionality.</description>

      <description>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rdquo; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below.</description>

      <title>Boo-Boo with the Bamboo Bike</title>

      <description>As you probably already know, I made a bamboo bike which I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. However, what you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.
I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo.</description>
