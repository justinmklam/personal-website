      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
 Poetry is hard
To write when algorithms
Are extremely dumb.
 I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. Theres nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually itll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description>

 Haikus are simple
Even children can write them
maybe programs too?
 Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description>
