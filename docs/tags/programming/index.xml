      <title>Monitoring the Fermentation of Sourdough Starter with Computer Vision</title>

      <description>Bread, the quintessence of life. People have survived for centuries off this staple consisting only of flour, water, salt, and yeast. Try consuming all these ingredients separately, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be in for a digestive surprise. However, mix them together and let time do its thing, and the result is the release of profound flavour, texture, and nutrients that were previously locked away.
Despite it being relatively easy to turn dough into something that looks and feels like bread, the challenge is in squeezing every possible ounce of flavour and texture (using only those four ingredients) to achieve the embodiment of a true loaf of bread.</description>

      <title>From Prototype to Cloud: A Python Recipe Converter</title>
      <link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</link>

      <description>In case the title wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear, this blog post is about developing a web application using the Python programming language using Jupyter Lab, Flask, and the Heroku platform. If you were looking for an article on python recipes, you can start off with this one on making a poached Burmese python curry.
The Backstory The problem with online baking recipes is that the majority of them use volumetric units. As any civilized baker would know, Patricia&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour may very well be different than Patrick&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour.</description>

      <title>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Ping Sweep in C# Windows Form</title>

      <description>As a mechatronics engineer (in training), sometimes I like to pretend that I also know how to program.
In my most recent adventures to software land at MistyWest, I needed to write an application in C# that involved doing a ping sweep to find devices that were physically connected through ethernet. Since Google and Stack Overflow are my two best friends, I was able to find (what seemed to be) an off-the-net solution quite quickly.</description>

      <title>Debugger Setup with GDB &#43; OpenOCD in Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/10/vscode-debugger-setup/</link>

      <description>Visual Studio Code&amp;rsquo;s combination of functionality, customizability, and aesthetics makes it one of my favourite code editors. As such, I was set on making it work with embedded development since I was getting started with the STM32 line of microcontrollers. I was following the steps outlined in Mastering STM32 by Carmine Noviello (which is an excellent resource) until it said to use Eclipse, because life&amp;rsquo;s too short to use software with unnecessary bloat.</description>

      <title>Engineer&#39;s Diary</title>
      <link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/10/engineers-diary/</link>

      <description>Background: Between paper notebooks, post-it notes, OneNote, Evernote, and so many more, there is no shortage of ways to write things down. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but none satisfied my requirements to act as a daily work log to record key events, thoughts, and milestones during my work day.
My paper notebook is excellent for free-form thoughts, sketches, and calculations, but I would want to keep a separate notebook to keep track of these sequential events.</description>

      <title>The Making of Project Haikuza: Part 2</title>
      <link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-ii/</link>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Poetry is hard To write when algorithms Are extremely dumb.  I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Haikus are simple Even children can write them maybe programs too?  Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description>

      <title>External Ballistics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/02/external-ballistics/</link>

      <guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/02/external-ballistics/</guid>
      <description>Background: including (but not limited to) drag, gravity, air density, altitude, rotation of the bullet, and rotation of the Earth.
One solution is to connect a computer to a manual targeting system (ie. a scope) and estimate the corrected target location by accounting for these external factors. The user may then line the manual targeting system up with the corrected target location, hoping to the high heavens that the target will be hit upon releasing the projectile.</description>
