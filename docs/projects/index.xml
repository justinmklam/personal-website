      <title>Engineer&#39;s Diary</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/software/engineers-diary/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/software/engineers-diary/</guid>
      <description>Background: Between paper notebooks, post-it notes, OneNote, Evernote, and so many more, there is no shortage of ways to write things down. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but none satisfied my requirements to act as a daily work log to record key events, thoughts, and milestones during my work day.
My paper notebook is excellent for free-form thoughts, sketches, and calculations, but I would want to keep a separate notebook to keep track of these sequential events.</description>

      <title>MECH 458: Capstone 3D Optical Well Imager</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/mech-458-capstone/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 12:57:32 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/mech-458-capstone/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Objective: Develop an optical scanning system to be used for generating 3D models of well liners and casings with sub-millimeter accuracy.
How: As a team of five mechatronic and mechanical engineering students, we designed and constructed an alpha prototype of the optical 3D well imager.
Requirements and Specifications Optical
 Device must have a tolerance on distance measurement of 1 mm Device must have a camera circumferential resolution of 1.</description>

      <title>Adjustable Portable Power Supply</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/elec/power-supply/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 17:29:58 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/elec/power-supply/</guid>
      <description>Objective: Build a cheap, portable, variable DC power supply.
Motivation: It was finally time to get my hands on a variable power supply for my electronics projects. Previous projects mainly involved Arduino, which was able to supply 5V and 3.3V with ease. However, the need for a supply with higher voltage, current, and flexibility eventually arose, resulting in the birth of this ghetto (but functional) power supply.
Limitations:
 Only DC voltages available Max current is a function of input power and desired voltage (I=P/V) Current limiting feature is non-existent, so must be careful to not let the genie out of circuits</description>

      <title>MECH 423: Mechatronics Product Design</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mecha/perfeggct/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 22:38:31 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mecha/perfeggct/</guid>
      <description>Background: When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.
 &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth overdoing.&amp;rdquo; - Jaime Hyneman
 Objective: Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.</description>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/software/haikuza/</guid>
      <description>Objective: Develop an algorithm to generate haikus using song lyrics.
Motivation: Because computational linguistics are cool.
Project: twitter.com/thehaikuza
Features:
 Scrapes Virgin Radio&amp;rsquo;s broadcast history to find recently played songs Creates a song-based haiku queue in Google Sheets Generates a haiku using the queue as a reference and posts it on Twitter Checks for new tweets every 5 minutes and generates a relevant haiku, if requested Finds all song lyrics from Lyrics Wikia Runs on a Raspberry Pi  Challenges:</description>

      <title>External Ballistics Simulation</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/software/external-ballistics/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 12:36:19 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/software/external-ballistics/</guid>
      <description>Background: including (but not limited to) drag, gravity, air density, altitude, rotation of the bullet, and rotation of the Earth.
One solution is to connect a computer to a manual targeting system (ie. a scope) and estimate the corrected target location by accounting for these external factors. The user may then line the manual targeting system up with the corrected target location, hoping to the high heavens that the target will be hit upon releasing the projectile.</description>

      <title>MECH 328: TrailRider Design Project</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/mech-328-trailrider/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 12:37:55 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/mech-328-trailrider/</guid>
      <description>Background: The TrailRider™ is a specialized device to provide accessibility to the wilderness for those with limited mobility. It is intended for a seated rider propelled and balanced by assistants.
Objective: Expand the range of both riders and assistants who can ride safely use the Black Diamond TrailRider™.
How: As a team of seven mechanical engineering undergrads, we explored a range of areas for improvement and developed a new design to incorporate these features.</description>

      <title>LEGO Headphones</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/lego-headphones/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2010 12:37:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/lego-headphones/</guid>
      <description>Background: I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go.</description>
