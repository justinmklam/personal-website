<h2 id="the-development-story">The Development Story</h2>

<p>We wanted a solution to increase and maintain presence in virtual reality; having to worry about tripping over the cable takes away from it. What we needed was a way to mimic a cable sherpa, following our every movement to prevent tension in the cable and entanglement around our legs. Whether we were moving forward, backward, left, right, or turning around, we wanted a way to roam freely as if virtual reality was already wireless.</p>

<h3 id="stage-1-design-and-testing">Stage 1: Design and Testing</h3>

<p>We wanted to make this as quickly as possible, so I designed the rig using off-the-shelf parts and laser cut acrylic parts.</p>

<p>Preliminary tests were less than stellar. I initially used relative position commands, but as the clip below shows, but it wasn&rsquo;t responsive enough for practical use.</p>

<p class="caption">Initial testing of the tracking using relative position commands, almost as if it has a mind of its own.</p>

<p>Changing the motor control to use absolute coordinates instead of relative showed promising results.</p>

<h3 id="stage-2-user-testing">Stage 2: User Testing</h3>

<p>The results were so promising, in fact, that we decided to strap it to the ceiling and do some user testing. The results were&hellip; Loud due to the rattling and vibrations from the stepper motors. System responsiveness was slow, so more work needed to be done.</p>

<p>Many revisions later, and the rig was finally working as expected!</p>

<h3 id="stage-3-making-it-portable">Stage 3: Making it &ldquo;Portable&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Since this was an internal project with <a href="https://mistywest.com/">MistyWest</a>, the value was in showing this prototype around. The social media content was one thing, but physically bringing it around was thought to have additional &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factors. Since CES 2017 was coming up and MistyWest would be hosting a penthouse party during one of the evenings, it was time to make this thing free standing.</p>

<p>Continuing the theme with 8020 extrusions, the external frame was assembled and tested.</p>

<p class="caption">Yes, it is in fact portable!</p>

<h3 id="stage-4-mission-complete">Stage 4: Mission Complete</h3>

<p>On January 6, 2017, the rig was set up in Las Vegas and (after some headache and remote debugging) the rig came alive at the <a href="https://mistywest.com/founders-friends-2017/">Founders and Friends 2017</a>. It was a huge hit amongst the tech enthusiasts and ran beautifully through the night.</p>

<p>The rig is now retired and sleeps soundly in its storage container. On to the next project!</p>
