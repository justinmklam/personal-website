      <title>Monitoring the Fermentation of Sourdough Starter with Computer Vision</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/06/sourdough-starter-monitor/</link>

      <description>Bread, the quintessence of life. People have survived for centuries off this staple consisting only of flour, water, salt, and yeast. Try consuming all these ingredients separately, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be in for a digestive surprise. However, mix them together and let time do its thing, and the result is the release of profound flavour, texture, and nutrients that were previously locked away.
Despite it being relatively easy to turn dough into something that looks and feels like bread, the challenge is in squeezing every possible ounce of flavour and texture (using only those four ingredients) to achieve the embodiment of a true loaf of bread.</description>

      <title>From Prototype to Cloud: A Python Recipe Converter</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>In case the title wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear, this blog post is about developing a web application using the Python programming language using Jupyter Lab, Flask, and the Heroku platform. If you were looking for an article on python recipes, you can start off with this one on making a poached Burmese python curry.
The Backstory The problem with online baking recipes is that the majority of them use volumetric units. As any civilized baker would know, Patricia&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour may very well be different than Patrick&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour.</description>

      <description>As a mechatronics engineer (in training), sometimes I like to pretend that I also know how to program.
In my most recent adventures to software land at MistyWest, I needed to write an application in C# that involved doing a ping sweep to find devices that were physically connected through ethernet. Since Google and Stack Overflow are my two best friends, I was able to find (what seemed to be) an off-the-net solution quite quickly.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Light therapy is one method of easing seasonal affective disorder (SAD); some people swear by it whereas others remain unaffected. This blog post does not intend to refute the effectiveness of light therapy, but rather to dig deeper into the technology behind these light therapy lamps to better educate fellow consumers.
Ah, the winter blues of Vancouver, BC. While some days bring bluebird skies and fresh pow for skiing, other days are downright gloomy.</description>

      <description>Visual Studio Code&amp;rsquo;s combination of functionality, customizability, and aesthetics makes it one of my favourite code editors. As such, I was set on making it work with embedded development since I was getting started with the STM32 line of microcontrollers. I was following the steps outlined in Mastering STM32 by Carmine Noviello (which is an excellent resource) until it said to use Eclipse, because life&amp;rsquo;s too short to use software with unnecessary bloat.</description>

      <description>Featured on Hackaday and Fictiv Blog! Yep, you heard it right. With all the craze surrounding cooking sous vide these days, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to venture using it outside of the culinary world. Turns out that someone also had a 3D printer, and you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!
Click-bait headlines aside, this post is quite lengthy and not everyone may have the patience to get through it all.</description>

      <description>Current high-performance virtual reality headsets require cable connections to a host computer. For room-scale VR, users must always be mindful of this cable since it poses not only as a tripping hazard, but also a detraction from the otherwise immersive VR experience. This autonomous cable management system is one solution to sucky cables.</description>

      <title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/solder-fume-extractor/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the 3D printing bug.
Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called The PerfEGGct. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process.</description>

      <description>By separating the internal and external cooking procedures, a perfect steak with no internal temperature gradient can be easily achieved. Cooking sous vide provides reliable, consistent, and precise results every time. An ESP8266 wifi chip was used to monitor and maintain the temperature controlled water.</description>

      <title>Tired of Cables in VR? We Are Too.</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/tired-of-cables/</link>

      <description>Originally posted on Medium under MistyWest.
Virtual reality pushes the envelope of bleeding edge technology, allowing us to explore and experience worlds beyond our mortal imaginations. It gives us immersion in another dimension, providing an unprecedented medium for communication and story telling. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then virtual reality must be worth millions. Except there’s one thing keeping it grounded to reality: cables.
Since the first virtual reality headset that was hacked together in 2011, immersive head-mounted displays have progressed far and quickly.</description>

      <description>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.
I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s generally known that cheap tools are usually not worth the trouble, but the deal on this bandsaw was simply too hard to pass up. With only a missing table, it was merely a quick woodworking project away from restoring its full functionality.</description>

      <description>I grew up watching Star Wars, and like any other eight-year old boy, I wanted to become a Jedi Knight. Maneuvering starfighters through the Hoth asteroid field whilst in aerial combat, jousting battle droids wielding nothing but a lightsaber, and having my hand sliced off to make space for my own mechno-arm were the epitomes of my childhood fantasy.
Reality came quite bluntly, yet these dreams continued to flourish. These days, they follow more along the lines of developing a steering system for a model hovercraft providing optimized maneuverability, attacking design challenges with a pen and paper, and studying the possibilities of bionic technology.</description>

      <description>Well liner repairs are costly and dangerous, and preventative measures are frequently taken by companies to minimize risk and future problems. The objective of this project was to develop an optical scanning system to be used for generating 3D models and images of liners, casings, and other types of pipe through fluids.</description>

      <description>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rdquo; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below.</description>

      <description>Gone are the days of blindly timing and boiling eggs, being left with nothing but a solid, chalky yolk. As part of our final year mechatronics engineering project, we developed a non-invasive device to measure the oscillation of an egg suspended on a spring. By analyzing the oscillatory response of the egg, we were able to determine the yolk consistency with (questionable) accuracy.</description>

      <description>As you probably already know, I made a bamboo bike which I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. However, what you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.
I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo.</description>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Poetry is hard To write when algorithms Are extremely dumb.  I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Haikus are simple Even children can write them maybe programs too?  Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description>

Oh boy, some beginner trip this turned out to be.
As a new member of the VOC, it quickly became apparent to me how &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; can take on drastically different meanings. In retrospect, I should have read the wiki page on &amp;ldquo;The 5 Definitions of Beginner Friendly&amp;rdquo; before agreeing to this little excursion, but a bit of Type II fun (not fun during, but makes for a great story later) never killed anyone, right?</description>

      <description>Background: Welcome to TZOA (pronounced &amp;lsquo;zoa&amp;rsquo;) - the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced environment tracker. TZOA uses internal sensors to measure your air quality, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, ambient light, and UV (sun) exposure, all in one wearable device.
Objective: Design and build a purified test chamber with zero air particulate to calibrate the TZOA devices against the DusTrak DRX 8533. An aerosolized cloud of ultrafine (0.3 - 20 μm) test dust was used to create the particle events.</description>

      <description>Long range trajectories are heavily susceptible to external factors including (but not limited to) drag, gravity, air density, altitude, rotation of the bullet, and rotation of the Earth. One solution is to connect a computer to a manual targeting system and estimate the corrected target location by accounting for these external factors. A basic program was developed to simulate and calculate the required correction.</description>

      <description>Foam liners in bicycle helmets absorb energy during impacts. Manufacturers recommend replacing a helmet every 2 to 10 years to maintain optimal head protection. To investigate this recommendation, we quantified the material and impact attenuation properties of helmets to determine if they changed with age.</description>
