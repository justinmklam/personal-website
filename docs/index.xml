      <title>Synchronous Vs Asynchronous Ping Sweep in C# Windows Form</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</guid>
      <description>As a mechatronics engineer1, sometimes I like to pretend to also know how to program.
In my most recent adventures to software land at MistyWest, I needed to write an application in C# that involved doing a ping sweep to find any connected devices. Since Google and Stack Overflow are my two best friends, I was able to find an off-the-net solution quite quickly. Additionally, this is a relatively well known objective so there are obvious libraries and methods to accomplish it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Light therapy is one method of easing seasonal affective disorder (SAD); some people swear by it whereas others remain unaffected. This blog post does not intend to refute the effectiveness of light therapy, but rather to dig deeper into the technology behind these light therapy lamps to better educate fellow consumers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Debugger Setup with GDB &#43; OpenOCD in Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/10/vscode-debugger-setup/</link>

      <description>Visual Studio Code&amp;rsquo;s combination of functionality, customizability, and aesthetics makes it one of my favourite code editors. As such, I was set on making it work with embedded development since I was getting started with the STM32 line of microcontrollers. I was following the steps outlined in Mastering STM32 by Carmine Noviello (which is an excellent resource) until it said to use Eclipse, because life&amp;rsquo;s too short to use software with unnecessary bloat.</description>

      <title>Annealing 3D Printed Plastics: Sous Vide Style</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/06/sous-vide-pla/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/06/sous-vide-pla/</guid>
      <description>Featured on Hackaday and Fictiv Blog! Yep, you heard it right. With all the craze surrounding cooking sous vide these days, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to venture using it outside of the culinary world. Turns out that someone also had a 3D printer, and you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!
Click-bait headlines aside, this post is quite lengthy and not everyone may have the patience to get through it all.</description>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/solder-fume-extractor/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.
At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been bit by the 3D printing bug.
Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called The PerfEGGct. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process.</description>

      <title>Tired of cables in VR? We are too.</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/tired-of-cables/</link>

      <description>Originally posted on Medium under MistyWest.
Virtual reality pushes the envelope of bleeding edge technology, allowing us to explore and experience worlds beyond our mortal imaginations. It gives us immersion in another dimension, providing an unprecedented medium for communication and story telling. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then virtual reality must be worth millions. Except there’s one thing keeping it grounded to reality: cables.
Since the first virtual reality headset that was hacked together in 2011, immersive head-mounted displays have progressed far and quickly.</description>

      <title>Wooden Phone Stand</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/</guid>
      <description>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.
I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs.</description>

      <title>Making Do With a Bargain Bin Bandsaw</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/bandsaw/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted a bandsaw. Being able to cut wood, plastics, etc. quickly and with flexibility has been a dream in my home shop. When I found an ad on Craigslist for a portable bandsaw for $50, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist. The main caveat was that it was missing a table, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big enough issue to turn me away from this killer deal.
Fresh off Craigslist in its table-naked glory.</description>

      <title>Engineer&#39;s Diary</title>

      <description>Background: Between paper notebooks, post-it notes, OneNote, Evernote, and so many more, there is no shortage of ways to write things down. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but none satisfied my requirements to act as a daily work log to record key events, thoughts, and milestones during my work day.
My paper notebook is excellent for free-form thoughts, sketches, and calculations, but I would want to keep a separate notebook to keep track of these sequential events.</description>

      <description>I grew up watching Star Wars, and like any other eight-year old boy, I wanted to become a Jedi Knight. Maneuvering starfighters through the Hoth asteroid field whilst in aerial combat, jousting battle droids wielding nothing but a lightsaber, and having my hand sliced off to make space for my own mechno-arm were the epitomes of my childhood fantasy.
Reality came quite bluntly, yet these dreams continued to flourish. These days, they follow more along the lines of developing a steering system for a model hovercraft providing optimized maneuverability, attacking design challenges with a pen and paper, and studying the possibilities of bionic technology.</description>

      <description>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3&amp;frasl;4&amp;rdquo; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below.</description>

      <title>Adjustable Portable Power Supply</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/elec/power-supply/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/elec/power-supply/</guid>
      <description>Objective: Build a cheap, portable, variable DC power supply.
Motivation: It was finally time to get my hands on a variable power supply for my electronics projects. Previous projects mainly involved Arduino, which was able to supply 5V and 3.3V with ease. However, the need for a supply with higher voltage, current, and flexibility eventually arose, resulting in the birth of this ghetto (but functional) power supply.
Limitations:
 Only DC voltages available Max current is a function of input power and desired voltage (I=P/V) Current limiting feature is non-existent, so must be careful to not let the genie out of circuits</description>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mecha/perfeggct/</guid>
      <description>Background: When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.
 &amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth overdoing.&amp;rdquo; - Jaime Hyneman
 Objective: Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.</description>

      <description>As you probably already know, I made a bamboo bike which I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of. However, what you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.
I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo.</description>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Poetry is hard To write when algorithms Are extremely dumb.  I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description>

      <description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Haikus are simple Even children can write them maybe programs too?  Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description>

      <description>Originally posted on The Ubyssey.
Oh boy, some beginner trip this turned out to be.
As a new member of the VOC, it quickly became apparent to me how &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; can take on drastically different meanings. In retrospect, I should have read the wiki page on &amp;ldquo;The 5 Definitions of Beginner Friendly&amp;rdquo; before agreeing to this little excursion, but a bit of Type II fun (not fun during, but makes for a great story later) never killed anyone, right?</description>

      <description>Background: Welcome to TZOA (pronounced &amp;lsquo;zoa&amp;rsquo;) - the world&amp;rsquo;s most advanced environment tracker. TZOA uses internal sensors to measure your air quality, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, ambient light, and UV (sun) exposure, all in one wearable device.
Objective: Design and build a purified test chamber with zero air particulate to calibrate the TZOA devices against the DusTrak DRX 8533. An aerosolized cloud of ultrafine (0.3 - 20 μm) test dust was used to create the particle events.</description>

      <description>Background: including (but not limited to) drag, gravity, air density, altitude, rotation of the bullet, and rotation of the Earth.
One solution is to connect a computer to a manual targeting system (ie. a scope) and estimate the corrected target location by accounting for these external factors. The user may then line the manual targeting system up with the corrected target location, hoping to the high heavens that the target will be hit upon releasing the projectile.</description>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/coop-drill-cover/</guid>
      <description>Background: Drill availability is a major limitation in developing countries, where surgeons turn to using manual hand-crank drills to perform surgeries. A common hardware drill equipped with a waterproof, sterilizable fabric cover provides a cost-effective solution in the operating room.
Objective: Develop, conduct, and analyze a study to quantify the drilling performance of the drill cover solution and compare it against a commercial surgical drill and a manual hand-crank drill.</description>

      <title>MECH 223: Hovercraft Competition</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2013/mech-223-hovercraft/</link>

      <guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2013/mech-223-hovercraft/</guid>
      <description>For our final MECH2 design project at UBC, we were given three weeks to research, conceptualize, test, and build a functional hovercraft. The end goal was a class-wide competition of speed, cargo capacity, maneuverability, and driving skill. Budget was limited since costs came out of our own pockets, so we set out to build an inexpensive hovercraft using parts from the hardware and dollar store.
Our result: 5th place out of 30 teams.</description>

      <title>LEGO Headphones</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/projects/mech/lego-headphones/</link>

      <description>Background: I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go.</description>

      <title>A Minty-Fresh Power Pack</title>
      <link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2009/altoids/</link>

      <description>Before the ubiquity of powerbanks, there was nothing on the market to provide longer battery life for portable electronics. Connecting a female USB connector to four rechargable AA batteries opened up a new world of extended iPod playback. I built a simple, rechargable battery pack to keep the tunes playing on long road trips.
The iPod is alive!
 President&amp;#39;s Choice rechargable batteries and some janky wiring is all it took.</description>
