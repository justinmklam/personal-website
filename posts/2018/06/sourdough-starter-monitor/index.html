People have survived for centuries off this staple consisting only of flour, water, salt, and yeast. Try consuming all these ingredients separately, and you&rsquo;ll be in for a digestive surprise. However, mix them together and let time do its thing, and the result is the release of profound flavour, texture, and nutrients that were previously locked away.</p><p>Despite it being relatively easy to turn dough into something that looks and feels like bread, the challenge is in squeezing every possible ounce of flavour and texture (using only those four ingredients) to achieve the embodiment of a true loaf of bread. The secret to artisinal bread is <strong>all in the fermentation.</strong> A baker&rsquo;s skill is in their ability to manage and control the fermentation process, which is usually achieved through countless months and/or years of trial and error.</p><p><strong>But what if there was a better way to understand what happens during the fermentation process?</strong></p><p>In this blog post, we dive into the world of wild yeast (commonly known as sourdough starter) by tracking its growth through timelapses, automated image analysis, and cool graph animations. Read on to find out more!</p><div class="row captioned-img"><video class="img-responsive img-content" autoplay loop=loop controls>

<source src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/2018-05-29%20Levain%20Timelapse.mp4 type=video/mp4></video><p class=caption>Image analysis for tracking growth of the above timelapse.</p></div><h1 id=the-backstory>The Backstory</h1><p>Two key components in making artisinal bread are <strong>time</strong> and <strong>fermentation</strong>. If you can afford a long, slow rise, you will be rewarded with a texture like no other, and flavours that are both complex and subtle. Most bakeries unfortunately do not have this luxury (since it&rsquo;s a business after all), so commercial instant dry yeast is used to expedite the fermentation such that it reaches the desired loaf volume at a reasonable schedule. With bread risen with instant dry yeast, it will definitely resemble visual qualities of bread, but the texture and taste will not be comparable to bread that uses wild yeast.</p><p>The quest for achieving the perfect loaf is an arduous one. It can take upwards of 12 hours from the first mix to actually being able to bake the loaf, and environmental factors (ie. temperature and humidity) can alter the dough&rsquo;s behaviour (ie. in how it absorbs water, or how fast/slow the fermentation occurs). With every loaf being slightly different, it can be challenging to identify what processes need adjusting to get one step closer to that perfect loaf.</p><p>For context, a typical process for making an artisinal loaf is roughly described below:</p><ol><li>Discard 80-90% of the sourdough starter and feed it with flour and water.</li><li>Wait a few hours for the starter to ferment and double or triple in size.</li><li>At its peak, take the starter and mix it in with the rest of the bread ingredients.</li><li>Gently fold the dough to tighten it up (which creates the gluten) a few times for the first 1-2 hours.</li><li>Let rest. Flavours are developed during this bulk fermentation period.</li><li>Shape the loaf and place it in a proofing basket.</li><li>Let rest. The final volume is achieved during this second fermentation.</li><li>Bake.</li><li>Place on cooling rack when done, and listen to the song of the crackling crust while you wait to cut it open.</li></ol><p>Sourdough starter is a living organism, and as such should be treated with kindness, respect, and most importantly, food. A well-fed starter is an active and happy one; if we can get a feel for how the starter behaves on a day-to-day basis during its feeding (ie. when the fermentation occurs), it may help clear up at least one of the variables in bread baking.</p><p>One way to achieve this understanding is simply through trial and error. But we can do better. We can use (rather simple) <strong>computer vision</strong>!</p><p>The loaf&rsquo;s holey texture (ie. the elusive open crumb) is largely determined by activeness of the starter, so this is where we shall put our initial efforts. <strong>Specifically, we want to understand</strong>:</p><ul><li>When the starter reaches its maximum fermentation,</li><li>How consistent the starter&rsquo;s fermentation is, and</li><li>What happens when the starter is neglected and how quickly it can come back to life.</li></ul><p>To answer these questions, our plan of action is to:</p><ol><li>Take a timelapse of starter</li><li>Write an image analysis script to locate the current height of the starter in each image</li><li>Plot the height over time to get its growth characteristics</li></ol><p>Enough with the walls of text. Let&rsquo;s get on to the fun stuff!</p><h1 id=the-development>The Development</h1><h2 id=setting-up-the-timelapse>Setting Up the Timelapse</h2><p>For ease and convenience, the timelapse was set up on a Raspberry Pi. I initially had the idea to eventually create a real-time analysis of the starter (ie. a Python script updating a locally hosted dashboard), but I figured post processing a timelapse was good enough for now to answer those questions. You can pretty much use any camera to take a timelapse.</p><h3 id=loading-the-raspberry-pi-zero-headless>Loading the Raspberry Pi Zero (Headless)</h3><p>Setting up a Raspberry Pi is very easy these days:</p><ol><li>Download <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>Raspbian</a></li><li>Flash it to an SD card with something like <a href=https://etcher.io/>Etcher</a></li></ol><p>The only hiccup I ran into was setting up without any monitor or ethernet attached, so getting it connected to WiFi and retrieving its IP address was non-trivial. Luckily, other people had run into the same problem over at the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=191252">Raspberry Pi forums</a>.
The solution:</p><ol><li>Create an empty file on the SD&rsquo;s boot partition called <code>ssh</code> to enable it.</li><li>Create another file named <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> with the following content:</li></ol><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback>country=US

    scan_ssid=1
    psk=&#34;your_real_password&#34;
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
</code></pre></div><p>Connect the camera module and boot it up. You can use something like <a href=https://angryip.org/download/#linux>Angry IP Scanner</a> to find its IP address, and with any luck you should be able to SSH into it from your own computer!</p><h3 id=creating-the-scripts>Creating the Scripts</h3><p>Fortunately, the Pi comes loaded with <code>raspistill</code>, a command line tool to capture images (see <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md>here</a> for documentation). All we need to do is to write a simple shell script to execute this command every N seconds to create a timelapse.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The easiest option is to use the built in <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/timelapse.md>timelapse mode</a>. However, I decided to make my own script to have more control over the filenames and where the images get saved.</p><h4 id=folder-structure>Folder Structure</h4><p>I set up two scripts, one to take the timelapses, and another to start the timelapse as a background process. The <code>run</code> script is in the home directory so I can execute the command right when I login through the command line.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-text data-lang=text>    home/pi/

From the image above, it looks like isodata, otsu, and yen provide the sharpest thresholded boundary.</p><p>Given a hot tip from my coworker (thanks Andreas) that Otsu&rsquo;s method is a good one to pick, we can dig deeper into it. From the docs:</p><blockquote><p>Otsu’s method calculates an “optimal” threshold (marked by a red line in the histogram below) by maximizing the variance between two classes of pixels, which are separated by the threshold. Equivalently, this threshold minimizes the intra-class variance. - <a href=http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_thresholding.html>SciKit Image Docs</a></p></blockquote><p>The main takeaway with Otsu&rsquo;s method is that it works best with a bimodal distribution. For our image, this means the histogram should be represented by two distinct peaks. Since our cropped image looks to have two visually different areas (ie. transparent glass at the top, flour/water mixture at the bottom), let&rsquo;s confirm that this method will work.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>plt.hist(img.ravel(), bins=256, range=(0.0, 1.0), fc=<span style=color:#a31515>&#39;k&#39;</span>, ec=<span style=color:#a31515>&#39;k&#39;</span>)

Plotting all the growths (as shown below), we see that they seem more similar than different. The peaks hover around 60-80%, and the rate of growth coming up to the peak are similar.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/all-growths_1.png><img class="img-responsive img-span-row" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/all-growths_1.png></a><p class=caption>All the timelapses plotted to compare normalized growth. Horizontal dotted line indicates 50% mark.</p></div><h3 id=effect-of-regular-feeding>Effect of Regular Feeding</h3><p>Taking only a select number of days, there is a clearer trend to be seen. The graph below shows how the growth magnitude and rate increases over frequent and regularly scheduled feedings.</p><p>On May 29th, we began to feed our sourdough starter after many months of sporadic feeding. With the June 10th growth, the ramp up occured later but eventually rises to ~80%. The ideal growth target is to double or triple in size, but hopefully that time will come with even more regular feeding.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/Levain%20Growth%20Over%20Time%20%28Regular%20Feeding%29.png><img class="img-responsive img-span-row" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/Levain%20Growth%20Over%20Time%20%28Regular%20Feeding%29.png></a><p class=caption>We can see that regularly feeding the sourdough starter greatly increases its rate and growth.</p></div><p><strong>Note</strong>: The time delay of each subsequent feeding is not a result of regularity, but rather because the starter to food ratio was reduced over time to promote a more active fermentation. We eventually migrated to a 50g starter + 100g water + 100g flour (50 / 50 white and whole wheat). The starter has more potential for growth by beginning with less starter and more food, but as a result it may take a bit longer for the bacteria to vigorously start multiplying.</p><h3 id=bringing-the-starter-back-to-life>Bringing the Starter Back to Life</h3><p>Previous to June 23, the starter was neglected for a week. After the first (overnight) feeding, it showed little signs of growth. However, feeding it again around noon and tracking its progress shows that the growth springs back up to ~80%, which was around the previous maximum from before.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/refeeding_1.png><img class="img-responsive img-span-row" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sourdough-starter-monitor/refeeding_1.png></a><p class=caption>What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (or at least as strong as before). First feeding is shifted because I forgot to start the timelapse right away.</p></div><p>Thus, a bit of neglect seems to be okay since the starter appears to be fairly resilient to starvation! (But if you&rsquo;re going on vacation, please feed it more than you typically would so it can sustain itself in your absence.)</p><h2 id=the-conclusion>The Conclusion</h2><p>So what can we take away from ~40 hours of watching yeast rise<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>? From all this, we learned:</p><ul><li>The rate of growth appears to be fairly consistent, even with poorly maintained starters</li><li>A healthy, regularly fed starter reaches maximum fermentation growth after 5-6 hours.</li><li>The peak has a ~1 hour window for when it should be used</li><li>Regularly feeding a neglected starter will make it (and you) happy again</li></ul><p>Even just taking a timelapse will give you a good feel for how your starter behaves, especially when you&rsquo;re starting out with baking bread. If you leave it overnight and come back the next morning to what looks like minimal growth, a timelapse can tell you if it peaked 3 hours in without you noticing, or if it actually didn&rsquo;t grow. Every starter is different, but if you can give it the attention it deserves, its fermentation will continually reward you with loaves like no other.</p><p>Happy baking!</p><hr><h1 id=further-reading>Further Reading</h1><p>Check out the links below to level-up your bread game.
