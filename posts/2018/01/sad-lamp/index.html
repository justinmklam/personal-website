While some days bring bluebird skies and <a href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/25e5bfdf6e824bfa330964b5e0e48855/tenor.gif?itemid=5287297">fresh pow</a> for skiing, other days are downright gloomy. Spending this past Christmas in Singapore meant warm, sunny, and +25Â°C weather, which is quite atypical of how most Canadians spend their winters.</p><p>However, coming back to the overcast, bone-chilling, gray, and wet Vancouver winter was a climate shock my body had yet to feel before. A week or so of jetlag-ridden sleep cycles and my circadian rhythm was back to normal, but I couldn&rsquo;t scratch the itch of yearning for sun and truly despising this city&rsquo;s gloomy winter weather.</p><p>Thanks to Amazon Prime&rsquo;s same/one day shipping, a solution to this problem was less than 24 hours away.

That is the Question</h3><p>Looking at the figure below, the trace in blue is the response with the frosted plastic in front of the bulb (ie. the lamp fully assembled). Surprise, surprise: the distinct peaks suggest that it is in fact a compact fluorescent bulb.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/Verilux%20Comparison.png><img class="img-responsive img-content" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/Verilux%20Comparison.png></a><p class=caption>Spectral responses with and without the UV diffuser/filter.</p></div><p>However, a typical fluorescent bulb has sharp peaks and a flat baseline.

Based on the spectral data collected by <a href=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2010/8/aafeature>Advanced Aquarist</a> shown below, the rounded peak is likely from an additional/different phosphor inside the tube. This creates additional fluorescence to shift the visible colour temperature towards a more daylight-esque tone (by adding more blue content). On the other hand, the soft white bulb shows a flat spectral base, as expected from our previous graphs.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/cfl_comparison.jpg><img class="img-responsive img-content" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/cfl_comparison.jpg></a><p class=caption>Spectral response of a daylight CFL bulb, 6500K (left) and soft white, 2700K (right). (Source: <a href=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2010/8/aafeature>Advanced Aquarist</a>)</p></div><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> CFL bulbs have similar spectral characteristics to daylight in terms of how our eyes interpret it. This particular light therapy lamp uses a standard 6500K CFL bulb, so you&rsquo;re kind of paying for the marketing hype.</p><h3 id=true-or-alternative-fact-uv-blocking-filter>True or Alternative Fact: UV Blocking Filter</h3><p>So now that we have our first question answered, let&rsquo;s get on with the second. The frosted filter/diffuser that comes with this lamp is advertised to ensure it is a UV-free light source. Is this an actual optical filter that transmits light beyond the UV wavelengths (> 400 nm), or does it just a piece of plastic?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look closely at the spectral characteristics. Zooming in to the 350 - 400 nm region and changing the y-axis to a log scale (to better visualize the data), we see that the peak around 365 nm is indeed attenuated by a factor of ~10. However, looking back at the original figure (above), we see that the entire spectral response is attenuated.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/Verilux%20Comparison%20-%20UV.png><img class="img-responsive img-content" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/Verilux%20Comparison%20-%20UV.png></a><p class=caption>Detailed look at the UV exposure on a logarithmic scale.</p></div><p>To put a number to this, we can numerically integrate the spectral power density at each wavelength and sum up the values to calculate irradiance (in units mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Over the entire measured spectrum of 350 - 800 nm, we see that the diffuser reduces the total brightness by ~48%. So instead of removing just the UV wavelengths, they diffused the entire spectrum until the UV exposure is low enough to meet the &ldquo;no UV exposure&rdquo; threshold.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/chart.png><img class="img-responsive img-content" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/chart.png></a><p class=caption>Comparison of total irradiance with and without the diffuser.</p></div><p>Integrating the UV region between 350 - 400 nm shows that there&rsquo;s still a bit of UV light that gets through. However, it&rsquo;s of insignificant amount compared to the UV exposure from other sources (ie. sun, TV, computer screen, etc.) that they can say that there&rsquo;s &ldquo;effectively no UV radiation&rdquo; from this lamp.</p><div class="row captioned-img"><a href=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/chart%20%281%29.png><img class="img-responsive img-content" src=/imgs/blog-imgs/sad-lamp/chart%20%281%29.png></a><p class=caption>Comparison of irradiance in the UV range, with and without the diffuser.</p></div><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> UV is removed by attenuating the entire spectral response of the CFL bulb until the UV light is removed (for practical purposes). Yes, the frosted diffuser also makes the lamp more user friendly (as staring into a bare bulb is rather jarring), but now you know that you can simply replace it with another diffuse material should you ever lose that part.</p><h1 id=the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel>The Light at the End of the Tunnel</h1><p>I hope this journey through light and its spectral characteristics was both entertaining and educational. With any luck, you may have learned a thing or two (and gained an appreciation) about all the different light sources surrounding you everyday.</p><p>Although you can build your own light therapy lamp for a fraction of its retail purchasing cost, that may not be a viable (or convenient) option for everyone. Additionally, light therapy is apparently more dependent on the brightness output rather than the actual wavelengths; as long as it&rsquo;s bright and white(-ish) then it should work for light therapy!</p><p>Whatever you choose to do with this information is up to you, so light up your own path to mitigating your SAD-ness :)</p><br><p><em><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong></em> <em>Thanks to <a href=https://mistywest.com/>MistyWest</a> for letting me use their spectrometer to measure this data!</em></p></div><br><div class=text-left><a class=blog-nav-btn href=/><span style=font-size:.83em class="glyphicon glyphicon-menu-left"></span>Recent Posts</a></div><hr><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var a,b;if(window.location.hostname=="localhost")return;a=document.createElement('script'),a.type='text/javascript',a.async=!0,b='justinmklam',a.src='//'+b+'.disqus.com/embed.js',(document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(a)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=http://disqus.com/ class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div><div class=col-sm-1><nav id=toc data-toggle=toc data-spy=affix></nav></div></div></div><script src=/js/jquery.js></script><script src=/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script src=/js/bootstrap-toc.min.js></script><script src=/js/highlight.pack.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()</script><script type=text/javascript src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script><script src=https://use.fontawesome.com/ccb78cc113.js></script><script id=dsq-count-scr src=//justinmklam.disqus.com/count.js async></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$('#hamburger-menu').click(function(){$(this).toggleClass('open')})})</script></body><footer><div class="col-lg-8 col-centered"><hr><p class=text-center>&copy; 2021 Justin MK Lam</p></div><div id=amzn-assoc-ad-8dae4bf9-b4e8-4c3d-8d99-cd2028a68840></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=8dae4bf9-b4e8-4c3d-8d99-cd2028a68840"></script></footer></html>
