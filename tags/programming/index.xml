It was neat to monitor it this way, but it was fairly impractical to do for each feeding since it required setting up a camera, downloading the images, and doing some manual image cropping before running it through my analysis script. The analysis was also only done after the fact, and what I really wanted was something that could tell me when the starter was ready to be used (or fed), or, if I missed the window of opportunity, how long ago it peaked.</description></item><item><title>Nordic nRF52 Development with Visual Studio Code</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/04/vscode-nrf52/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 14:14:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/04/vscode-nrf52/</guid><description>A few years ago, I created a tutorial on setting up Visual Studio Code for development with the STM32. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve also been developing on the Nordic nRF52, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share another tutorial to show how a project can be set up, flashed, and debugged using Visual Studio Code.
The template project discussed in this post can be found on Github.
Instructions The Nordic toolchain is cross-platform, but the instructions below are specifically for Linux.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring the Fermentation of Sourdough Starter with Computer Vision</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/06/sourdough-starter-monitor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 17:50:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/06/sourdough-starter-monitor/</guid><description>Bread, the quintessence of life. People have survived for centuries off this staple consisting only of flour, water, salt, and yeast. Try consuming all these ingredients separately, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be in for a digestive surprise. However, mix them together and let time do its thing, and the result is the release of profound flavour, texture, and nutrients that were previously locked away.
Despite it being relatively easy to turn dough into something that looks and feels like bread, the challenge is in squeezing every possible ounce of flavour and texture (using only those four ingredients) to achieve the embodiment of a true loaf of bread.</description></item><item><title>From Prototype to Cloud: A Python Recipe Converter</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 20:33:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</guid><description>In case the title wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear, this blog post is about developing a web application using the Python programming language using Jupyter Lab, Flask, and the Heroku platform. If you were looking for an article on python recipes, you can start off with this one on making a poached Burmese python curry.
The Backstory The problem with online baking recipes is that the majority of them use volumetric units. As any civilized baker would know, Patricia&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour may very well be different than Patrick&amp;rsquo;s 1 cup of flour.</description></item><item><title>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Ping Sweep in C# Windows Form</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 17:02:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</guid><description>As a mechatronics engineer (in training), sometimes I like to pretend that I also know how to program.
In my most recent adventures to software land at MistyWest, I needed to write an application in C# that involved doing a ping sweep to find devices that were physically connected through ethernet. Since Google and Stack Overflow are my two best friends, I was able to find (what seemed to be) an off-the-net solution quite quickly.</description></item><item><title>Debugger Setup with GDB + OpenOCD in Visual Studio Code</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/10/vscode-debugger-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 14:24:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/10/vscode-debugger-setup/</guid><description>Visual Studio Code&amp;rsquo;s combination of functionality, customizability, and aesthetics makes it one of my favourite code editors. As such, I was set on making it work with embedded development since I was getting started with the STM32 line of microcontrollers. I was following the steps outlined in Mastering STM32 by Carmine Noviello (which is an excellent resource) until it said to use Eclipse, because life&amp;rsquo;s too short to use software with unnecessary bloat.</description></item><item><title>Overhead Robotic Gantry for Tethered VR Headsets</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/04/vr-gantry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/04/vr-gantry/</guid><description>Project Overview Objective: Create an autonomous gantry to follow the HTC Vive headset around, keeping its cable behind the user at all times.

Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but none satisfied my requirements to act as a daily work log to record key events, thoughts, and milestones during my work day.
My paper notebook is excellent for free-form thoughts, sketches, and calculations, but I would want to keep a separate notebook to keep track of these sequential events.</description></item><item><title>The Making of Project Haikuza: Part 2</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-ii/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 23:49:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-ii/</guid><description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Poetry is hard To write when algorithms Are extremely dumb. I dont want my haiku generator to be a vegetarian chef. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with always making word salad, but eventually it&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn to make fancier things. A poetic risotto would be nice from time to time.
Leaving @thehaikuza to make complete gibberish wasnt what I had intended.</description></item><item><title>The Making of Project Haikuza: Part 1</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 23:49:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-i/</guid><description>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of @thehaikuza.
Haikus are simple Even children can write them maybe programs too? Nothing is cooler than algorithmic poetry. Except for maybe Carl Sagan. I heard he was a pretty cool guy.
I was listening to the radio while driving home one Sunday evening, and an ad came up for a university that was submitting computer-generated poetry to a literature competition.</description></item><item><title>Project Haikuza</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/07/haikuza/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 11:42:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/07/haikuza/</guid><description>Objective: Develop an algorithm to generate haikus using song lyrics.
Motivation: Because computational linguistics are cool.
Project: twitter.com/thehaikuza
Features:
Scrapes Virgin Radio&amp;rsquo;s broadcast history to find recently played songs Creates a song-based haiku queue in Google Sheets Generates a haiku using the queue as a reference and posts it on Twitter Checks for new tweets every 5 minutes and generates a relevant haiku, if requested Finds all song lyrics from Lyrics Wikia Runs on a Raspberry Pi Challenges:</description></item><item><title>External Ballistics Simulation</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/02/external-ballistics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2015 11:38:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/02/external-ballistics/</guid><description>Background: including (but not limited to) drag, gravity, air density, altitude, rotation of the bullet, and rotation of the Earth.
One solution is to connect a computer to a manual targeting system (ie. a scope) and estimate the corrected target location by accounting for these external factors. The user may then line the manual targeting system up with the corrected target location, hoping to the high heavens that the target will be hit upon releasing the projectile.</description></item><item><title>MATLAB Photo Editing Script</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/01/photo-editing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 11:45:14 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/01/photo-editing/</guid><description>Objective: Develop a script to find and remove any differences in a series of photos.
