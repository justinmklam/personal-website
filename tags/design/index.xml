It was neat to monitor it this way, but it was fairly impractical to do for each feeding since it required setting up a camera, downloading the images, and doing some manual image cropping before running it through my analysis script. The analysis was also only done after the fact, and what I really wanted was something that could tell me when the starter was ready to be used (or fed), or, if I missed the window of opportunity, how long ago it peaked.</description></item><item><title>3D Printed Engagement Ring</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:50:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</guid><description>Professional photos from Justine Russo Photography. For readers of my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring.
With this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing the ring, along with some *minor* mistakes I made.</description></item><item><title>Overhead Robotic Gantry for Tethered VR Headsets</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/04/vr-gantry/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:26:50 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/04/vr-gantry/</guid><description>Project Overview Objective: Create an autonomous gantry to follow the HTC Vive headset around, keeping its cable behind the user at all times.
Motivation: An extravagant party prop for an evening at CES 2017, hosted by MistyWest.
Features:
CoreXY planar gantry design System built with 8020 aluminum extrusions and laser cut acrylic components Stepper motor control through Teensy 3.2 HTC Vive pose tracking through C++ Patent pending Skills:</description></item><item><title>MECH 458: Capstone 3D Optical Well Imager</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/06/mech-458-capstone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 12:57:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/06/mech-458-capstone/</guid><description>Introduction Objective: Develop an optical scanning system to be used for generating 3D models of well liners and casings with sub-millimeter accuracy.
How: As a team of five mechatronic and mechanical engineering students, we designed and constructed an alpha prototype of the optical 3D well imager.
Project Details Requirements and Specifications Optical Device must have a tolerance on distance measurement of 1 mm Device must have a camera circumferential resolution of 1.</description></item><item><title>MECH 423: Mechatronics Product Design</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/04/perfeggct/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 22:38:31 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/04/perfeggct/</guid><description>Background: When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.
&amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth overdoing.&amp;rdquo; - Jaime Hyneman
Objective: Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.</description></item><item><title>MECH 328: TrailRider Design Project</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/11/mech-328-trailrider/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 12:37:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/11/mech-328-trailrider/</guid><description>Background: The TrailRider™ is a specialized device to provide accessibility to the wilderness for those with limited mobility. It is intended for a seated rider propelled and balanced by assistants.
Objective: Expand the range of both riders and assistants who can ride safely use the Black Diamond TrailRider™.
How: As a team of seven mechanical engineering undergrads, we explored a range of areas for improvement and developed a new design to incorporate these features.</description></item><item><title>Bowling With car2go</title><link>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/08/car2go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 12:37:42 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/08/car2go/</guid><description>Objective: Design a roof-mounted bowling rig for a car2go marketing event.
Constraints: Use a non-permanent method to securely attach the apparatus to the roof.
Venue: 2014 Vancouver Fringe Festival
Bowling rig set up and ready to roll.

Challenges:
Constructing a frame jig to allow freedom around joints for carbon-fibre layup Accounting for the non-uniformity of bamboo poles at the frame lugs Maintaining compatibility with standard bicycle components Ensuring the frame is treated for typical"Wet" Coast weather Awards:

This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go.</description></item></channel></rss>
