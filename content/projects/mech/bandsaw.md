__Background:__ High school woodworking was awesome. Making things is awesome. Making things that make other things is even more awesome. Making things that make other things at home by fixing used tools is the awesome-est. 

__Objective:__ Make a table for a bandsaw with a missing table. No fuss, no muss (just lots of sawdust).

{{<img caption="Attempt #2: Completed table support with angle adjustment from the slotted hole. Also note the modified  knob handle above to provide easier adjustment."
