### Consulting

Need a hand with something you're working on?  I have gained a wide range of skills through my technical projects that will help me help you.  Please take a gander through my [projects]({{ .Site.BaseURL }}) and [LinkedIn profile](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/justinmklam) for more details regarding my capabilities, including:

+ Mechanical Design
+ Mechanical Testing
+ 3D Modeling (SolidWorks)
+ Rapid Prototyping 
+ Programming (C, C#, C++, Python, VBA, MATLAB, Octave)
+ Technical Writing
+ Data Analysis

Whether your project is small and sensible or big and outlandish, I'd love to hear about it!  Ring me up and we can work out the details.

### Tutoring

I will not tell you how to solve problems, nor will I look at the solution manual and simply give you the answers.  What I will do is challenge your thought process and teach you how to think critically, providing you with the necessary tools to approach and solve problems from your own understanding.  With a bit of help from me and a bit of work by you, your grades are guaranteed to improve.
