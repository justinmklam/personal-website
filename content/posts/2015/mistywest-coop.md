__Background:__ Welcome to TZOA (pronounced 'zoa') - the world's most advanced environment tracker. TZOA uses internal sensors to measure your air quality, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, ambient light, and UV (sun) exposure, all in one wearable device.

__Objective:__ Design and build a purified test chamber with zero air particulate to calibrate the TZOA devices against the DusTrak DRX 8533. An aerosolized cloud of ultrafine (0.3 - 20 Î¼m) test dust was used to create the particle events.
