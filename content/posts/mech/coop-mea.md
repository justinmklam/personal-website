summary = "Foam liners in bicycle helmets absorb energy during impacts. Manufacturers recommend replacing a helmet every 2 to 10 years to maintain optimal head protection. To investigate this recommendation, we quantified the material and impact attenuation properties of helmets to determine if they changed with age."

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Determine if age has an effect on the mechanical properties of bicycle helmets.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Conducted 1630 helmet impact attenuation tests to measure the effect of age and use on bicycle helmet foam</li>
	<li>Developed scripts in MATLAB to autonomously post-process the impact data and organize information according to existing helmet databases</li>
	<li>Wrote the Methods section of the research report to be submitted to the Accident Prevention &amp; Analysis Journal</li>
	<li>Assisted in protocol development of the helmet and foam core impact attenuation tests</li>
</ul>
