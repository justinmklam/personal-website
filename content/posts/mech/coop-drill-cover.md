<p><strong>Background:</strong> Drill availability is a major limitation in developing countries, where surgeons turn to using manual hand-crank drills to perform surgeries.  A common hardware drill equipped with a waterproof, sterilizable fabric cover provides a cost-effective solution in the operating room.</p>

<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Develop, conduct, and analyze a study to quantify the drilling performance of the drill cover solution and compare it against a commercial surgical drill and a manual hand-crank drill.</p>
