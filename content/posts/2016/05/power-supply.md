__Objective:__ Build a cheap, portable, variable DC power supply.

__Motivation:__ It was finally time to get my hands on a variable power supply for my electronics projects. Previous projects mainly involved Arduino, which was able to supply 5V and 3.3V with ease. However, the need for a supply with higher voltage, current, and flexibility eventually arose, resulting in the birth of this ghetto (but functional) power supply.

__Limitations:__

+ Only DC voltages available
+ Max current is a function of input power and desired voltage (I=P/V)
+ Current limiting feature is non-existent, so must be careful to not let the genie out of circuits
