My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4's and a 3/4" MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below. The builders left some 1/8" plywood in the yard, and I wanted to see how sturdy of a chair I can make with it given the inherent flimsiness of the thin sheet stock. By adding a reinforcing cross-brace at the base of the legs, I was able to significantly increase its sturdiness.

For a stool made with the cheapest possible wood, it actually turned out half-decent and it does what it needs to do!
