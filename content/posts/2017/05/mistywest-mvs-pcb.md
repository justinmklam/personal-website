__Objective:__

+ Design a custom PCB to protect and regulate a 14.8V LiPo battery for use with an autonomous RC car

__Features:__

+ 12V undervoltage and 10A overcurrent protection
+ 8.4V, 7.4V, and 5V regulated outputs

__Main Components:__

+ [LT6109](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/linear-technology/LT6109AHMS-2-PBF/LT6109AHMS-2-PBF-ND/3844948) High Side Current Sense Amplifier
+ [RT8288AZSP](https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/richtek-usa-inc/RT8288AZSP/1028-1148-1-ND/3078151) Synchronous Step-Down Converter

__Skills:__

+ Reading and understanding datasheets
+ Schematic capture and PCB layout in Altium Designer
+ Board bring-up
+ Hardware debugging

__Achievement Unlocked:__

+ A mechanical engineer doing electrical engineering
