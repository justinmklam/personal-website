__Background:__ Gone are the days of blindly timing and boiling eggs and being left with nothing but a bad yolk. As part of our final year mechatronics engineering project, we developed a device that measures the oscillation of an egg suspended on a spring. When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.

__Objective:__ Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.
	
__Motivation:__ As part of our final year engineering course, we were tasked to create a mechatronics device of our choosing. This project was heavily inspired by [Matthias Wandel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckETVOT59aYw80B36aP9vw) and his [boiled egg hardness tester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9w1CZkTr0).

__Functional Requirements:__

+ Measure egg mass from strain gauge
+ Measure oscillation from accelerometer
+ Control LCD screen
+ Mechanical design and fabrication
+ Integration and user interaction study
+ C# interface
+ MATLAB data analysis

__Limitations:__ This prototype was developed in 3 weeks during school and has approximately 80% repeatability.
