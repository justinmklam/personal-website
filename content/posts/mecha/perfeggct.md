<p><strong>Background: </strong>Gone are the days of blindly timing and boiling eggs and being left with nothing but a bad yolk. As part of our final year mechatronics engineering project, we developed a device that measures the oscillation of an egg suspended on a spring. When a hard boiled egg is spun on a table, it rotates freely since the inside is completely solid. With a raw egg, the liquid yolk sloshes around and resists rotation. By using math and physics, we can analyze the rotational oscillation of an egg and determine the yolk consistency.

<p><em>"If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing." - Jaime Hyneman</em></p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Design and build a device to determine how cooked a boiled egg is using non-invasive techniques.
</p>
	
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> As part of our final year engineering course, we were tasked to create a mechatronics device of our choosing. This project was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckETVOT59aYw80B36aP9vw">Matthias Wandel</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw9w1CZkTr0">boiled egg hardness tester</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Limitations: </strong>This prototype was developed in 3 weeks during school and has approximately 80% repeatability.</p>
