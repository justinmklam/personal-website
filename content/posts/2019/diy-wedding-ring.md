For readers of my blog, you'll notice that I haven't had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife's engagement ring. Having experience with mechanical design and rapid manufacturing methods, I figured it was well within my capabilities to propose with a truly special, sentimental engagement ring.

With this post, I'd like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing my wife's engagement ring, along with the *minor* mistakes I made.

# The Backstory

{{<loop-vid caption="Timelapse of the ring design in Fusion 360. (Yes I know, I should have just used a revolve feature, but I started out designing prongs and quickly abandoned that concept.)" src="/imgs/blog-imgs/diy-wedding-ring/fusion 360 screencast_trimmed.mp4">}}

# The Development

## Planning
*~ September to October 2018 ~*

I casually brought up engagement ring designs with Heather, and she showed me a few designs that she liked.

{{<img caption="Design research and inspirations." src="/imgs/blog-imgs/diy-wedding-ring/inspiration.png">}}

Once I started to hone down on the desired design, I started my research on how to secure the stone.

Qualitative videos are great, but what I needed were actual dimensions on wall thickness, height, bend distance, etc. After much Googling, I fortunately found an article with the information I needed!

## Initial Design
*~ October 11 to 17, 2018 ~*

Luckily, one of my coworkers, [Phil Tsao](http://www.philiptsao.com), owns a plethora of rapid prototyping machines as part of his [Ember Prototypes](https://www.emberprototypes.com) side business. One of his fancy toys is the [Form 2 SLA Printer](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-2/), which is well suited for printing intricate plastic parts with fine details.

{{<img caption="You can see that the shape is quite blocky." src="/imgs/blog-imgs/diy-wedding-ring/IMG_20181018_123554.jpg" >}}

## Refinement
*~ October 22, 2018 ~*

Iterations are a key part of design (for both hardware and software). Seeing a physical prototype of the ring was extremely useful in determining what aspects needed changing.

I was unhappy with how blocky and square the ring currently looked, so I took a closer look at other rings to see what made them look better. After all, they say good design is invisible (to the untrained eye, and my eye for ring design is pretty inexperienced). One main aspect is that almost all surfaces on rings (and other jewelry, for that matter) are curved, allowing light to reflect off the surface in a more aesthetically pleasing way.

Given these findings, my list of change orders were as follows:

- Increase height of stone holder to make it "stand out" more
- Increase visibility of leaf pattern on band
- Increase height of ridge on band for a more pronounced look
- Round both inner and outer surfaces of band for comfort and aesthetic improvements

I hadn't used [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com) previously, but their offerings and capabilities looked promising. Aside from printing plastics and metals, [jewelry](https://www.shapeways.com/getting-started/jewelry) also seemed to be a common offering.

> Gold models are 3D printed using a complex five-step process. First, the model is printed in wax using a specialized high-resolution 3D printer. It is then put in a container where liquid plaster is poured in around it. When the plaster sets, the wax is melted out in a furnace, and the remaining plaster becomes the mold.
>
> Molten Gold is poured into this mold and set to harden. The plaster is broken away, revealing your new product. The product is then carefully cleaned and hand-polished to give it the trademark Gold luster. Please be aware that polishing can wear down or fill in very fine details and edges. Polishing also removes a bit of material from your product in order to smooth it out, so the exact volume may be up to 10% smaller than that of your digital model.

If my timeline was more permitting, I would have printed this second version in an inexpensive metal like plated brass or silver. This would ensure the end result of the ring is exactly how I expect it to be, rather than have the risk of being surprised on the final order. However, given my expedited timeline, I opted to take the risk and just go for ordering the ring in 14K gold. If I ended up unhappy with it, paying another ~$200 would be acceptable (in my books) since the flipside of the risk was potentially proposing a few weeks earlier (and thus giving more time for the wedding planning!).

## Setting the Diamond

*~ November 6, 2018 ~*

Now, for the most critical part! After scouring YouTube and Google for instructions on how to set the stone, I came to the conclusion that it's actually quite a simple process:

1. Find a tool to form the edge over the stone
2. Bend the edge over the stone with the given tool'
3. Repeat for the circumference of the bezel

There are different tools available to do the bending. In the video below, a hammer-like tool is used to compress the edge on to the stone. In other videos, a file-like tool is pushed toward the center to bend the edge. I looked around my workshop, and
