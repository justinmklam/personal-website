# Setting Up Headless Raspberry Pi

Source: [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=191252)

Step 1: Create an empty file. You can use Notepad on Windows or TextEdit to do so by creating a new file. Just name the file `ssh`. Save that empty file and dump it into boot partition (microSD).

Step 2: Create another file name `wpa_supplicant.conf`. This time you need to write a few lines of text for this file. For this file, you need to use the FULL VERSION of wpa_supplicant.conf. Meaning you must have the 3 lines of data namely country, ctrl_interface and update_config

> If a wpa_supplicant.conf file is placed into the /boot/ directory, this will be moved to the /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory the next time the system is booted, overwriting the network settings; this allows a Wifi configuration to be preloaded onto a card from a Windows or other machine that can only see the boot partition.

```

network={
    ssid="your_real_wifi_ssid"
    scan_ssid=1
    psk="your_real_password"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
