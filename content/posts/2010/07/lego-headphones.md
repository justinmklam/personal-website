__Background:__ I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I'm quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go. No tools necessary!

__Objective:__ Use LEGO to create the external assembly of a pair of headphones.
