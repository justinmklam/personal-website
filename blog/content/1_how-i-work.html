<p><em>Adapted from Lifehacker's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work" target="_blank">How I Work</a> interview series. (Last edit: August 17, 2015)</em></p>

<p><strong>Location</strong>: Vancouver, BC</p>

<p><strong>Current</strong> <strong>gig</strong>: Mechanical Design Intern at <a href="http://www.mistywest.com/" target="_blank">MistyWest</a></p>

<p><strong>Current mobile device</strong>: Rooted Nexus 4 running <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-4/development/rom-chroma-03-31-2015-layers-t3069936" target="_blank">Chroma 5.1.1 (Lollipop)</a></p>

<p><strong>Current computer</strong>: Microsoft Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10</p>

<p><strong>One word that best describes how you work</strong>: Enthusiastically</p>

<p><strong>What's your workspace like?</strong></p>

<p>The Surface Pro 3 is pretty darn close to having the best of both worlds with the portability of a laptop/tablet and functionality of a desktop. As a student, being able to take notes electronically is a game changer! It's amazingly thin and light to carry around, and I can also plug it into desktop peripherals when things need to get serious. FYI the Pro 3 is surprisingly capable of running SolidWorks!</p>

<p><strong>What apps/software/tools can't you live without?</strong></p>

<em>Apps</em>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>.  Keeps my entire life organized. 'Nuff said.</li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>.  I need something to maintain my slurry of lists and unsorted thoughts, and this fits the bill nicely.</li>
	<li><a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> + <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/ereading/gifts/kobo-aura-black/681495005864-item.html" target="_blank">Kobo</a>.  This is a deadly combo.  I can look for articles on my computer or phone (usually with <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a>), save them to Pocket and have them wirelessly sync with my e-reader.  Being able to read long web articles on an e-ink display is a definitive game changer (and blessing for my eyes!).</li>
</ul>
<em>Software</em>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">Autohotkey</a>.  Setting or rebinding hotkeys, being able to highlight text from any program and search it on Google, and adding tab scrolling in Chrome are only a few things I use Autohotkey for.  It's sort of amazing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techspot.com/downloads/5897-winsplit-revolution.html" target="_blank">WinSplit Revolution</a>.  Albeit discontinued, it provides an excellent way to manage desktop estate by tiling the windows in any desired configuration.</li>
</ul>
<em>Tools</em>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G600-Gaming-Mouse-Black/dp/B0086UK7IQ" target="_blank">Logitech G600</a>. I never would have thought a multi-button gaming mouse could change my life.  I can do all computer related tasks with blazing speed now that majority of my mouse move-and-click actions are now binded to one of the 24 available thumb buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's your favorite to-do list manager?</strong></p>

<p>I'm a long time lover of Google Tasks since it integrates nicely with Google Calendar and Gmail.  In the past, I have probably spent an unproductive amount of time testing different GTD apps when I should have been actually getting things done...</p>

<p><strong>Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can't you live without?</strong></p>

<p>A watch. Sure, a smartphone can tell the time (plus so much more), but I really appreciate the no-frills convenience of simply rotating my wrist to see the time. My trusty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casio-DW5600E-1V-G-Shock-Classic-Digital/dp/B000GAYQKY" target="_blank">Casio 5600E</a> has proven to be an extremely comfortable and bombproof addition to my everyday carry.</p>

<p><strong>What's your best time-saving trick?</strong></p>

<p>Writing things down so I don't have to spend time trying to remember it later on.  I'm partial to having a heavy reliance on my fleeting memory.</p>

<p><strong>What everyday thing are you better at than anyone else?</strong></p>

<p>Staying organized and using hotkeys.  For the latter, I like how they (eventually) become muscle memory and keep my workflow going forward.  My thoughts otherwise become disjointed if I'm constantly switching gears to move my mouse around the screen.</p>

<p><strong>What are you currently reading?</strong></p>

<p><em>The Martian</em> by Andy Weir. I can't stress enough how thoroughly I've been enjoying it.</p>

<p><strong>What do you listen to while you work?</strong></p>

<p>Deep house or video game soundtracks on Google Music.</p>

<p><strong>Are you more of an introvert or an extrovert?</strong></p>

<p>A bit of both. As much as a recharge from spending time with others, I've been finding myself spending more time doing solo activities. Sometimes it's nice to be able to go at one's own pace!</p>

<p><strong>What's your sleep routine like?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes I like to pretend I'm an early riser, but weekends reveal my true colours.  I try to get 7-8 hours every night, but I've been known to run off 5 hours in a pinch if I don't think about it too much.</p>

<p><strong>Fill in the blank: I'd love to see ______ answer these same questions.</strong></p>

<p>Bill Nye.  Oh wait, he already made one <a href="http://lifehacker.com/im-bill-nye-and-this-is-how-i-work-1680700332" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<p><strong>What's the best advice you've ever received?</strong></p>

<p>Don't compare yourself to others.  However, it has become progressively more difficult in this day and age where everyone is showing off their highlight reels on a superfluous number of social media platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add?</strong></p>

<p>Britney survived 2007.  You can survive today.</p>
