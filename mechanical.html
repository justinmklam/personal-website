        <h4>Integrating computer vision with automated pipeline inspection.</h4>
        <p>Pipeline repairs are costly and dangerous, and preventative measures are frequently taken by companies to minimize risk and future problems. The objective of this project was to develop an optical scanning system to be used for generating 3D models and images of liners, casings, and other types of pipe through fluids.</p>

        <p>Foam liners in bicycle helmets absorb energy during impacts. Manufacturers recommend replacing a helmet every 2 to 10 years to maintain optimal head protection. To investigate this recommendation, we quantified the material and impact attenuation properties of helmets to determine if they changed with age.</p>
