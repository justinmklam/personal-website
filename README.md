# Personal Project Website
Increasing my online presence by showcasing projects and posts that I've worked on over the years.

# Dependencies
+ Static website created using Hugo engine
+ Theme template created using Bootstrap framework

# How To Use
## Basic Hugo commands
To compile the website (where output is in `docs/` folder):
```
hugo
```
or to include drafts,
```
hugo -D
```
To start a local server for live website testing (at localhost:1313):
```
hugo -D serve
```
## Adding Content

To create a new blog post:
```
hugo new /posts/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[TITLE].md
```

__Note:__ Upload images, files, etc. in the `static/` directory.

## Publishing
The `docs/` folder in this repo is published on GitHub Pages. Use the `deploy.sh` script to build and publish the website.

```bash
# Uses autogenerated commit message
./deploy.sh

# Optional: Add a descriptive message to the commit to be published
./deploy.sh "My commit message"
```
